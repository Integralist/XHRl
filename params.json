(aka jQuery which cryptically hides errors)\r\n* I wanted to avoid typical browser sniffs used to keep execution order (e.g. LABjs)\r\n* I wanted to avoid using hacks ([such as...](http://www.phpied.com/preload-then-execute/)) - used in a few script loaders.\r\n\r\nDisclaimer\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI wrote this script not to compete with any of the existing script loaders, but to learn something new by the virtue of trying to build one for myself.\r\n\r\nLimitations\r\n-----------\r\n\r\nOne limitation of this script loader is that because it relies on `XMLHttpRequest` all scripts loaded must be hosted on your own domain (i.e. you can't call jQuery from the Google CDN). Now for my use cases this isn't a problem, but for some people this may be a big deal. Take it or leave it.\r\n\r\nOther Script Loaders\r\n--------------------\r\n\r\nHere's a list of other script loaders I've looked at...\r\n\r\n* [LABjs](https://github.com/getify/LABjs)\r\n* [YepNope.js](https://github.com/SlexAxton/yepnope.js)\r\n* [RequireJs](https://github.com/jrburke/requirejs)\r\n* [HeadJs](https://github.com/headjs/headjs)\r\n* [ControlJs](http://stevesouders.com/controljs/)\r\n* [Steal](https://github.com/jupiterjs/steal) (part of JMVC library)\r\n* [loadrunner](https://github.com/danwrong/loadrunner/)","google":""}
